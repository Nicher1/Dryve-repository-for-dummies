# DryvePY-repository-for-dummies
Repository for the Dryve D1 track. Included in the repository are two example scripts and a variety of functions, that have been documented in this [word document](How%20to%20control%20the%20Dryve%20D1%20over%20Python). The aforementioned scripts cover moving to a set point on the track, and oscilating around a set 'home point' respectively.

Config file for the Dryve D1 can be found [here](Configuration%20for%20guide.txt)
